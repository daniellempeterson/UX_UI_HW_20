            <p class="lead">Currently, there is a lack of knowledge and accessibility to environmentally friendly practices, such as recycling. We 
              found that users want to become more eco-friendly, but are unsure of how to properly dispose of products and found it difficult to access local resources.
            The goal for the EcoGeek app is to help users easily and accurately discard products and access their local resources, thereby, improving personal
          satisfaction and helping save the planet.</p>

    <button class="accordion">User Interviews</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>User interviews were conducted to gather insight on potential user's recycling habits and goals. Five interviews were conducted, transcribed on 
        sticky notes and further organized into an affinity diagram in order to see similarities in user's responses. Key insights included: users want to 
      recycle for the good of the environment; most understand the idea of recycling, but get confused about city/town specific rules; users like to be 
    given directions on how to properly dispose of products; would like feedback on how their decisions make a positive impact on their environment.</p>

    <button class="accordion">User Persona</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>After collecting qualitative data from our interviews, the user persona, Cecelia Greene was born. Cecelia is a 27 year-old female who is interested
        in increasing her "green" habits, needs to be able to easily access information about eco-friendly practices, in order to become more
      environmentally conscious and feel personal satisfaction. </p>

      <p>A user journey map was created to understand Cecelia's interaction with the EcoGeek app in order to achieve her goals of making a positive impact
        on the environment and become a more competent recycler. She is determined to make more eco-conscious decisions, but isn't sure where to start.
        She finds the EcoGeek app and quickly finds how to properly dispose of each product.

                <h1 class="display-10">Problem Statement</h1>
              <p class="lead">We believe that providing accessible information about green practices, as well as allowing documentation
                of contributions to people aspiring to be more eco-friendly, will increase interest in environmental sustainability and personal satisfaction.

<!--Prototype that Solved Initial Problem Statement in col-system-->

<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <h1 class="display-10"> Prototyping</h1>
    <div class="col-lg">
    Each team member sketched out a paper prototype of the app. We shared our prototypes, voted on our
    favorite pieces from each to create a low-fi clickable prototype. Collaboration from team members
    helped create a more robust initial prototype.
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg">
      A paper prototype was developed for the first found of usability testing with four participants.
    Participants were asked to complete three tasks that access the main features of the app:
    sign up/onboard, find local "green practices", scan an item to determine recyclability.
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg">
      The biggest takeaways included: 3/4 users felt confused when trying to navigate the home page
      and access specific features. Users also helped us realize that the location icon was confusing,
      and the map feature did not serve a real purpose, which further added to difficulty completing the task.

                    comprehension; added a home button; changed barcode to camera to increase understanding of the feature's purpose.

                <div class="mx-auto" style="width:800px;">
              <h1 class="display-10">Conclusion & Final Thoughts</h1>
              <p class="lead">
                For the second round of usability testing with a mid-fi prototype, users completed sign-up/onboarding with 100%; locating local green practices with 100% 
                and scanning items for recyclability with 87.5% success rates.

                Overall, the development of EcoGeek highlighted the importance of implementing small eco-friendly behaviors to
                facilitate larger environmental sustainability. By implementing the design process, we were able to address real user problems and pain points including:
                access to education on local green practices; improving ease of recycling products by providing a tangible solution. This project allowed for virtual teamwork
                and collaboration. Each team member came from a different background and experience level, allowing us to create a well-rounded and strong prototype.
